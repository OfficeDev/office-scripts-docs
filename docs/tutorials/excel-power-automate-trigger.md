# Automatically run scripts with Power Automate (preview)

This tutorial teaches you how to use an Office Script for Excel on the web with an automated [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) workflow. Your script will automatically run each time you receive an email, recording information from the email in an Excel workbook.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Tutorial prerequisites](../includes/tutorial-prerequisites.md)]

- [Preview access to Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/flow-preview-program/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial assumes you have completed the [Run Office Scripts in Excel on the web with Power Automate](excel-power-automate-manual.md) tutorial.

## Prepare the workbook

Power Automate can't use [relative references](../develop/power-automate-integration.md#avoid-using-relative-references) like `Workbook.getActiveWorksheet` to access workbook components. So, we need a workbook and worksheet with consistent names for Power Automate to reference.

1. Create a new workbook named **MyWorkbook**.

2. Go to the **Automate** tab and select **Code Editor**.

3. Select **New Script**.

4. Replace the existing code with the following script and press **Run**. This will setup the workbook with consistent worksheet, table, and PivotTable names.

    ```TypeScript
    async function main(context: Excel.RequestContext) {
      // Add a new worksheet to store our email table
      let workbook = context.workbook;
      let worksheets = workbook.worksheets;
      let emailsSheet = worksheets.add("Emails");

      // Add data and create a table
      emailsSheet.getRange("A1:D1").values = [
        ["Date", "Day of the week", "Email address", "Subject"]
      ];
      let tables = workbook.tables;
      let newTable = tables.add(emailsSheet.getRange("A1:D2"), true);
      newTable.name = "EmailTable";

      // Add a new pivot table to a new worksheet
      let pivotWorksheet = worksheets.add();
      let pivotTables = workbook.pivotTables;
      let newPivotTable = pivotTables.add("Pivot", "EmailTable", pivotWorksheet.getRange("A3:C20"));
      pivotWorksheet.name = "SubjectPivot";

      // Setup the pivot hierarchies
      newPivotTable.rowHierarchies.add(newPivotTable.hierarchies.getItem("Day of the week"));
      newPivotTable.rowHierarchies.add(newPivotTable.hierarchies.getItem("Email address"));
      newPivotTable.dataHierarchies.add(newPivotTable.hierarchies.getItem("Subject"));
    }
    ```

## Create an Office Script for your automated workflow

Let's create a script that logs information from an email. We want to know how which days of the week we receive the most mail and how many unique senders are sending that mail. Our workbook has a table with **Date**, **Day of the week**, **Email address**, and **Subject** columns. Our worksheet also has a PivotTable that is pivoting on the **Day of the week** and **Email address** (those are the row hierarchies). The count of unique **Subjects** is the aggregated information being displayed (the data hierarchy). We'll have our script refresh that PivotTable after updating the email table.

1. From within the **Code Editor**, select **New Script**.

2. The flow that we'll create later in the tutorial will send our script information about each email that's received. The script needs to accept that input through parameters in the `main` function. Replace the default script with the following script:

    ```TypeScript
    async function main(
      context: Excel.RequestContext,
      from: string,
      dateReceived: string,
      subject: string): Promise<void> {

    }
    ```

3. The script needs access to the workbook's table and PivotTable. Add the following code to the body of the script, after the opening `{`:

    ```TypeScript
    // Get the email table.
    let emailWorksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Emails");
    let table = emailWorksheet.tables.getItem("EmailTable");

    // Get the PivotTable.
    let pivotTableWorksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Pivot");
    let pivotTable = pivotTableWorksheet.pivotTables.getItem("SubjectPivot");
    ```

4. The `dateReceived` parameter is of type `string`. Let's convert that to a [`Date` object](../develop/javascript-objects.md#date) so we can easily get the day of the week. After doing that, we'll need to map the day's number value to a more readable version. Add the following code to the end of your script, before the closing `}`:

    ```TypeScript
    // Parse the received date string.
    let date = new Date(dateReceived);

    // Convert number representing the day of the week into the name of the day.
    let dayText : string;
    switch (date.getDay()) {
      case 0:
        dayText = "Sunday";
        break;
      case 1:
        dayText = "Monday";
        break;
      case 2:
        dayText = "Tuesday";
        break;
      case 3:
        dayText = "Wednesday";
        break;
      case 4:
        dayText = "Thursday";
        break;
      case 5:
        dayText = "Friday";
        break;
      default:
        dayText = "Saturday";
        break;
    }
    ```

5. The `subject` string may include the "RE:" reply tag. Let's remove that from the string so that emails in the same thread have the same subject for the table. Add the following code to the end of your script, before the closing `}`:

    ```TypeScript
    // Remove the reply tag from the email subject to group emails on the same thread.
    let subjectText = subject.replace("Re: ", "");
    subjectText = subjectText.replace("RE: ", "");
    ```

6. Now that the email data has been formatted to our liking, let's add a row to the email table. Add the following code to the end of your script, before the closing `}`:

    ```TypeScript
    // Add the parsed text to the table.
    table.rows.add(-1, [[dateReceived, dayText, from, subjectText]]);
    ```

7. Finally, let's make sure the PivotTable is refreshed. Add the following code to the end of your script, before the closing `}`:

    ```TypeScript
    // Refresh the PivotTable to include the new row.
    pivotTable.refresh();
    ```

8. Rename your script **Record Email** and press **Save script**.

Your script is now ready for a Power Automate workflow. It should look like the following script:

```TypeScript
async function main(
  context: Excel.RequestContext,
  from: string,
  dateReceived: string,
  subject: string): Promise<void> {
  // Get the email table.
  let emailWorksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Emails");
  let table = emailWorksheet.tables.getItem("EmailTable");

  // Get the PivotTable.
  let pivotTableWorksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Pivot");
  let pivotTable = pivotTableWorksheet.pivotTables.getItem("SubjectPivot");

  // Parse the received date string.
  let date = new Date(dateReceived);

  // Convert number representing the day of the week into the name of the day.
  let dayText : string;
  switch (date.getDay()) {
    case 0:
      dayText = "Sunday";
      break;
    case 1:
      dayText = "Monday";
      break;
    case 2:
      dayText = "Tuesday";
      break;
    case 3:
      dayText = "Wednesday";
      break;
    case 4:
      dayText = "Thursday";
      break;
    case 5:
      dayText = "Friday";
      break;
    default:
      dayText = "Saturday";
      break;
  }

  // Remove the reply tag from the email subject to group emails on the same thread.
  let subjectText = subject.replace("Re: ", "");
  subjectText = subjectText.replace("RE: ", "");

  // Add the parsed text to the table.
  table.rows.add(-1, [[dateReceived, dayText, from, subjectText]]);

  // Refresh the PivotTable to include the new row.
  pivotTable.refresh();
}
```
