# Return data from a script to an automatically-run Power Automate flow (preview)

This tutorial teaches you how to use an Office Script for Excel on the web with an automated [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) workflow. Your script will automatically run each time you receive an email, recording information from the email in an Excel workbook. Being able to pass data from other applications into an Office Script gives you a great deal of flexibility and freedom in your automated processes.

> [!TIP]
> If you are new to Office Scripts, we recommend starting with the [Record, edit, and create Office Scripts in Excel on the web](excel-tutorial.md) tutorial. If you are new to Power Automate, we recommend starting with the [Call scripts from a manual Power Automate flow](excel-power-automate-manual.md) tutorial. [Office Scripts use TypeScript](../overview/code-editor-environment.md) and this tutorial is intended for people with beginner to intermediate-level knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript. If you're new to JavaScript, we recommend starting with the [Mozilla JavaScript tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction).
