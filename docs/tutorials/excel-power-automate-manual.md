# Run Office Scripts in Excel on the web with Power Automate (preview)

This tutorial teaches you how to run an Office Script for Excel on the web through [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Tutorial prerequisites](../includes/tutorial-prerequisites.md)]

- [Preview access to Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/flow-preview-program/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial assumes you have completed the [Record, edit, and create Office Scripts in Excel on the web](excel-tutorial.md) tutorial.

## Prepare the workbook

Power Automate can't use relative references like `Workbook.getActiveWorksheet` to access workbook components. So, we need a workbook and worksheet with consistent names that Power Automate can reference.

1. Create a new workbook named **MyWorkbook**.

2. In the **MyWorkbook** workbook, create a worksheet called **TutorialWorksheet**.

## Create an Office Script

1. Go to the **Automate** tab and select **Code Editor**.

2. Select **New Script**.

3. Replace the default script with the following script. This script adds the current date and time to the first two cells of the **TutorialWorksheet** worksheet.

    ```TypeScript
    async function main(context: Excel.RequestContext) {
      // Get the "TutorialWorksheet" worksheet from the workbook.
      let worksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("TutorialWorksheet")

      // Get the cells at A1 and B1.
      let dateRange = worksheet.getRange("A1");
      let timeRange = worksheet.getRange("B1");

      // Get the current date and time using the JavaScript Date object.
      let date = new Date(Date.now());

      // Add the date string to A1.
      dateRange.values = [[date.toLocaleDateString()]];

      // Add the time string to B1.
      timeRange.values = [[date.toLocaleTimeString()]];
    }
    ```

4. Rename the script to **Set date and time**. Press the script name to change it.

5. Save the script by pressing **Save Script**.

## Create an automated workflow with Power Automate

1. Sign in to the [Power Automate preview site](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com).

2. In the menu that's displayed on the left side of the screen, press **Create**. This brings you to list of ways to create new workflows.

3. In the **Start from blank** section, select **Instant flow**. This creates a manually activated workflow.

4. In the dialog window that appears, enter a name for your flow in the **Flow name** text box, select **Manually trigger a flow** from the list of options under **Choose how to trigger the flow**, and press **Create**.

    - **Script**: Set date and time

9. Press **Save**.

Your flow is now ready to be run through Power Automate. You can test it using the **Test** button in the flow editor or follow the remaining tutorial steps to run the flow from your flow collection.

## Run the script through Power Automate

1. From the main Power Automate page, select **My flows**.

2. Select **My tutorial flow** from the list of flows displayed in the **My flows** tab. This shows the details of the flow we previously created.

3. Press **Run**.

4. A task pane will appear for running the flow. If you are asked to **Sign in** to Excel Online, do so by pressing **Continue**.

5. Press **Run flow**. This runs the flow, which runs the related Office Script.

6. Press **Done**. You should see the **Runs** section update accordingly.

7. Refresh the page to see the results of the Power Automate. If it succeeded, go to the workbook to see the updated cells. If it failed, verify the flow's settings and run it a second time.
