# Combine worksheets into a single workbook

This sample shows how to pull data from multiple workbooks into a single, centralized workbook. It uses two scripts: one to retrieve information from a workbook and another to create new worksheets with that information. It combines the scripts in a Power Automate flow that acts on an entire OneDrive folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This sample only copies the values from the other workbooks. It does not preserve formatting, charts, tables, or other objects.

## Solution

1. Create a new Excel file in your OneDrive. The file name "Combination.xlsx" is used in this sample.
1. Create and save the two scripts from this sample.
1. Create a folder in your OneDrive and add one or more workbooks with data to it. The folder name "output" is used in this sample.
1. Build a flow (as described in the [Power Automate flow](#power-automate-flow-combine-worksheets-into-a-single-workbook) section of this article) to perform these steps:
    1. Get all the files the "output" folder.
    1. Use the **Return worksheet data** script to get the data from every worksheet in each of the workbooks.
    1. Use the **Add worksheets** script to create a new worksheet in the "Combination.xlsx" workbook for every worksheet in all the other files.

## Sample code: Return worksheet data

```TypeScript
/**
 * This script returns the values from the used ranges on each worksheet.
 */
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook): WorksheetData[]
{
  // Create an object to return the data from each worksheet.
  let worksheetInformation: WorksheetData[] = [];

  // Get the data from every worksheet, one at a time.
  workbook.getWorksheets().forEach((sheet) => {
    let values = sheet.getUsedRange()?.getValues();
    worksheetInformation.push({
       name: sheet.getName(),
       data: values as string[][]
    });
  });

  return worksheetInformation;
}

// An interface to pass the worksheet name and cell values through a flow.
interface WorksheetData {
  name: string;
  data: string[][];
}
```

## Sample code: Add worksheets

```TypeScript
/**
 * This script creates a new worksheet in the current workbook for each WorksheetData object provided.
 */
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook, workbookName: string, worksheetInformation: WorksheetData[])
{
  // Add each new worksheet.
  worksheetInformation.forEach((value) => {
    let sheet = workbook.addWorksheet(`${workbookName}.${value.name}`);

    // If there was any data in the worksheet, add it to a new range.
    if (value.data) {
      let range = sheet.getRangeByIndexes(0, 0, value.data.length, value.data[0].length);
      range.setValues(value.data);
    }
  });
}

// An interface to pass the worksheet name and cell values through a flow.
interface WorksheetData {
  name: string;
  data: string[][];
}
```

## Power Automate flow: Combine worksheets into a single workbook

1. Sign into [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) and create a new **Instant cloud flow**.
1. Choose **Manually trigger a flow** and select **Create**.
1. Add a **New step** to get all the workbooks you want to combine from their folder. Use the **OneDrive for Business** connector and the **List files in folder** action. For the **Folder** field, use the file picker to select the "output" folder.

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/combine-worksheets-flow-1.png" alt-text="The completed OneDrive for Business connector in Power Automate.":::
1. Add a **New step** to run the **Return worksheet data** script to get all the data from each of the workbooks. Use the **Excel Online (Business)** connector with the **Run script** action. Use the following values for the action. Note that when you add the *Id* for the file, Power Automate will wrap the action in an **Apply to each** control, so the action will be performed on every file.
    * **Location**: OneDrive for Business
    * **Document Library**: OneDrive
    * **File**: *Id* (dynamic content from **List files in folder**)
    * **Script**: Return worksheet data
1. Add a **New step** to run the **Add worksheets** script on the new Excel file you created. This will add the data from all the other workbooks. After the previous **Run script** action and inside the **Apply to each** control, add an **Excel Online (Business)** connector with the **Run script** action. Use the following values for the action.
    * **Location**: OneDrive for Business
    * **Document Library**: OneDrive
    * **File**: "Combination.xlsx" (your file, as selected by the file picker)
    * **Script**: Add worksheets
    * **workbookName**: *Name* (dynamic content from **List files in folder**)
    * **worksheetInformation** (see the note following the next image): *result* (dynamic content from **Run script**)

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/combine-worksheets-flow-2.png" alt-text="The two Run script actions inside the Apply to each control.":::
    > [!NOTE]
    > Select the **Switch to input entire array** button to add the array object directly, instead of individual items for the array.
    >
    > :::image type="content" source="../../images/combine-worksheets-flow-3.png" alt-text="The button to switch to input an entire array in a control field input box.":::
1. Save the flow. Use the **Test** button on the flow editor page or run the flow through your **My flows** tab. Be sure to allow access when prompted.
1. The "Combination.xlsx" file should now have new worksheets.

## Troubleshooting

- **A resource with the same name or identifier already exists**: This error likely indicates the "Combination.xlsx" workbook already has a worksheet with the same name. This will happen if you run the flow multiple times with the same workbooks. Create a new workbook each time to store the combined data or use different file names in the "output" folder.
- **The argument is invalid or missing or has an incorrect format**: This error can mean that the generated  worksheet name doesn't meet [Excel's requirements](https://support.microsoft.com/office/rename-a-worksheet-3f1f7148-ee83-404d-8ef0-9ff99fbad1f9). This is likely because the name is too long. One solution is to replace the code in "Add worksheets" that calls `addWorksheet` with something that shortens the string. Since the workbook name itself might be too long, add an incrementing number to the end of the worksheet name.

  ```TypeScript
  let worksheetNumber = 1;
  let worksheetName = `${workbookName}.${value.name}`;
  let sheet = workbook.addWorksheet(`${worksheetName.substr(0,30)}${worksheetNumber++}`);
  ```
