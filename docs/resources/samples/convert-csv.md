# Convert CSV files to Excel workbooks

Many services export data as comma-separated value (CSV) files. This solution automates the process of converting those CSV files to Excel workbooks in the .xlsx file format. It uses a [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) flow to find files with the .csv extension in a OneDrive folder and an Office Script to copy the data from the .csv file into a new Excel workbook.

## Solution

1. Store the .csv files and a blank "Template" .xlsx file in a OneDrive folder.
1. Create an Office Script to parse the CSV data into a range.
1. Create a Power Automate flow to read the .csv files and pass their contents to the script.

## Sample files

Download <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-scripts-docs/blob/master/docs/resources/samples/convert-csv-example.zip?raw=true">convert-csv-example.zip</a> to get the Template.xlsx file and two sample .csv files. Extract the files into a folder in your OneDrive. This sample assumes the folder is named "output".

Add the following script and build a flow using the steps given to try the sample yourself!

## Sample code: Insert comma-separated values into a workbook

```TypeScript
/**
 * Convert incoming CSV data into a range and add it to the workbook.
 */
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook, csv: string) {
  let sheet = workbook.getWorksheet("Sheet1");

  // Remove any Windows \r characters.
  csv = csv.replace(/\r/g, "");

  // Split each line into a row.
  let rows = csv.split("\n");
  /*
   * For each row, match the comma-separated sections.
   * For more information on how to use regular expressions to parse CSV files,
   * see this Stack Overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48806378/9227753
   */
  const csvMatchRegex = /(?:,|\n|^)("(?:(?:"")*[^"]*)*"|[^",\n]*|(?:\n|$))/g
  rows.forEach((value, index) => {
    if (value.length > 0) {
        let row = value.match(csvMatchRegex);
    
        // Check for blanks at the start of the row.
        if (row[0].charAt(0) === ',') {
          row.unshift("");
        }
    
        // Remove the preceding comma.
        row.forEach((cell, index) => {
          row[index] = cell.indexOf(",") === 0 ? cell.substr(1) : cell;
        });
    
        // Create a 2D array with one row.
        let data: string[][] = [];
        data.push(row);
    
        // Put the data in the worksheet.
        let range = sheet.getRangeByIndexes(index, 0, 1, data[0].length);
        range.setValues(data);
    }
  });

  // Add any formatting or table creation that you want.
}
```

## Power Automate flow: Create new .xlsx files

1. Sign into [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) and create a new **Scheduled cloud flow**.
1. Set the flow to **Repeat every** "1" "Day" and select **Create**.
1. Get the template Excel file. This is the basis for all the converted .csv files. Add a **New step** that uses the **OneDrive for Business** connector and the **Get file content** action. Provide the file path to the "Template.xlsx" file.
    * **File**: /output/Template.xlsx
1. Rename the **Get file content** step by going to the **Menu for Get file content(â€¦)** menu of that step (in the upper right corner of the connector) and selecting the **Rename** option. Change the step name to "Get Excel template".

     :::image type="content" source="../../images/convert-csv-flow-1.png" alt-text="The completed OneDrive for Business connector in Power Automate, renamed to be Get Excel template.":::
1. Get all the files in the "output" folder. Add a **New step** that uses the **OneDrive for Business** connector and the **List files in folder** action. Provide the folder path that contains the .csv files.
    * **Folder**: /output

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/convert-csv-flow-2.png" alt-text="The completed OneDrive for Business connector in Power Automate.":::
1. Add a condition so that the flow only operates on .csv files. Add a **New step** that is the **Condition** control. Use the following values for the **Condition**.
    * **Choose a value**: *Name* (dynamic content from **List files in folder**). Note that this dynamic content has multiple results, so an **Apply to each** *value* control surrounds the **Condition**.
    * **ends with** (from the dropdown list)
    * **Choose a value**: .csv

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/convert-csv-flow-3.png" alt-text="The completed Condition control with the Apply to each control around it.":::
1. The rest of the flow is under the **If yes** section, since we only want to act on .csv files. Get an individual .csv file by adding a **New step** that uses the **OneDrive for Business** connector and the **Get file content** action. Use the **Id** from the dynamic content from **List files in folder**.
    * **File**: *Id* (dynamic content from the **List files in folder** step)
1. Rename the new **Get file content** step to "Get .csv file". This helps distinguish this file from the Excel template.
1. Make the new .xlsx file, using the Excel template as the base content. Add a **New step** that uses the **OneDrive for Business** connector and the **Create file** action. Use the following values.
    * **Folder Path**: /output
    * **File Name**: *Name without extension*.xlsx (choose the *Name without extension* dynamic content from the **List files in folder** and manually type ".xlsx" after it)
    * **File Content**: *File content* (dynamic content from **Get Excel template**)

     :::image type="content" source="../../images/convert-csv-flow-4.png" alt-text="The Get .csv file and Create file steps of the Power Automate flow.":::
1. Run the script to copy data into the new workbook. Add the **Excel Online (Business)** connector with the **Run script** action. Use the following values for the action.
    * **Location**: OneDrive for Business
    * **Document Library**: OneDrive
    * **File**: *Id* (dynamic content from **Create file**)
    * **Script**: Convert CSV
    * **csv**: *File content* (dynamic content from **Get .csv file**)

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/convert-csv-flow-5.png" alt-text="The completed Excel Online (Business) connector in Power Automate.":::
1. Save the flow. Use the **Test** button on the flow editor page or run the flow through your **My flows** tab. Be sure to allow access when prompted.
1. You should find new .xlsx files in the "output" folder, alongside the original .csv files. The new workbooks contain the same data as the CSV files.

## Troubleshooting

### Script testing

To test the script without using Power Automate, assign a value to `csv` before using it. Add the following code as the first line of the `main` function and select **Run**.

```TypeScript
  csv = `1, 2, 3
         4, 5, 6
         7, 8, 9`;
```

### Semicolon-separated files and other alternative separators

Some regions use semicolons (';') to separate cell values instead of commas. In this case, you need to change the following lines in the script.

1. Replace the commas with semicolons in the regular expression statement. This starts with `let row = value.match`.

    ```TypeScript
    let row = value.match(/(?:;|\n|^)("(?:(?:"")*[^"]*)*"|[^";\n]*|(?:\n|$))/g);
    ```

1. Replace the comma with a semicolon in the check for the blank first cell. This starts with `if (row[0].charAt(0)`.

    ```TypeScript
    if (row[0].charAt(0) === ';') {
    ```

1. Replace the comma with a semicolon in the line that removes the separation character from the displayed text. This starts with `row[index] = cell.indexOf`.

   ```TypeScript
      row[index] = cell.indexOf(";") === 0 ? cell.substr(1) : cell;
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> If your file uses tabs or any other character to separate the values, replace the `;` in the above substitutions with `\t` or whatever character is being used.

### Large CSV files

If your file has hundreds of thousands of cells, you could reach the [Excel data transfer limit](../../testing/platform-limits.md#excel). You'll need to force the script to synchronize with Excel periodically. The easiest way to do this is to call `console.log` after a batch of rows has been processed. Add the following lines of code to make this happen.

1. Before `rows.forEach((value, index) => {`, add the following line.

    ```TypeScript
      let rowCount = 0;
    ```

1. After `range.setValues(data);`, add the following code. Note that depending on the number of columns, you may need to reduce `5000` to a lower number.

    ```TypeScript
      rowCount++;
      if (rowCount % 5000 === 0) {
        console.log("Syncing 5000 rows.");
      }
    ```

> [!WARNING]
> If your CSV file is very large, you may have problems [timing out in Power Automate](../../testing/platform-limits.md#power-automate). You'll need to divide the CSV data into multiple files before converting them into Excel workbooks.
