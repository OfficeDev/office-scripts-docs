# Add comments in Excel

This sample shows how to add comments to a cell including [@mentioning](https://support.microsoft.com/office/90701709-5dc1-41c7-aa48-b01d4a46e8c7) a colleague.

## Example scenario

* The team lead maintains the shift schedule. The team lead assigns an employee ID to the shift record.
* The team lead wishes to notify the employee. By adding a comment that @mentions the employee, the employee is emailed with a custom message from the worksheet.
* Subsequently, the employee can view the workbook and respond to the comment at their convenience.

## Solution

1. The script extracts employee information from the employee worksheet.
1. The script then adds a comment (including the relevant employee email) to the appropriate cell in the shift record.
1. Existing comments in the cell are removed before adding the new comment.

    const table = scheduleSheet.getTables()[0];
    const range = table.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal();
    const scheduleData = range.getTexts();

    for (let i=0; i < scheduleData.length; i++) {
      let eId = scheduleData[i][3];

      let employeeInfo = employees.find(e => e[0] === eId);
      if (employeeInfo) {
        console.log("Found a match " + employeeInfo);
        let adminNotes = scheduleData[i][4];
        try { 
          let comment = workbook.getCommentByCell(range.getCell(i, 5));
          comment.delete();
        } catch {
            console.log("Ignore if there is no existing comment in the cell");
        }
        workbook.addComment(range.getCell(i,5), {
          mentions: [{
            email: employeeInfo[1],
            id: 0,
            name: employeeInfo[2]
          }],
          richContent: `<at id=\"0\">${employeeInfo[2]}</at> ${adminNotes}`
        }, ExcelScript.ContentType.mention);        
        
      } else {
        console.log("No match for: " + eId);
      }
