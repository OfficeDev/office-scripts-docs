# Office Scripts samples and scenarios

This section contains Office Scripts based solutions that help end users achieve automation of daily tasks. It contains realistic scenarios that users face and provides detailed solutions.

- [Basics](#basics) showcase common examples that make up larger scripts. They're categorized based on a common Excel feature.
- [Quick scenarios](#quick-scenarios) are samples that are more involved or solve a particular problem.
- [Cross-application scenarios](#cross-application-scenarios) are samples that use Power Automate with one or more Office Scripts as integral parts of the flow.
- [Real-world scenarios](#real-world-scenarios) are a few larger samples framed as complete, real-world solutions.
- [Contributions from the community](#community-contributions-and-fun-samples) are samples from members of the Office Scripts community, often light-hearted in nature.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure you meet the prerequisites for Office Scripts before trying the samples. The requirements for your Microsoft 365 subscription and account are found under [Platform support](../../testing/platform-limits.md#platform-support).

## Basics

| Project | Details |
|---------|---------|
| [Ranges: Work with the grid](range-samples.md) | These samples show how to work the `Range` object, which is central to most scripts. |
| [Data validation samples: Dropdown lists, prompts, and warning pop-ups](data-validation-samples.md) | These samples show how to use data validation to mandate specific conditions for cell data and how the user is alerted to these rules. |
| [Date samples](javascript-dates.md) | A collection of samples that show how to translate between JavaScript and Excel date formats. |
| [Image samples](add-image-to-workbook.md) | This sample adds an image to a workbook and copies an image across sheets.|
| [Row and column visibility samples](row-and-column-visibility.md) | A collection of samples that demonstrate how to show, hide, and freeze rows and columns. |
| [Table samples](table-samples.md) | A collection of samples that show common interactions with Excel tables. |

## Quick scenarios

Be sure to download the sample workbooks included with each sample. That lets you skip setup and understand the core concept the sample demonstrates.

| Project | Details |
|---------|---------|
| [Copy multiple Excel tables into a single table](copy-tables-combine.md) | This sample combines data from multiple Excel tables into a single table that includes all the rows. |
| [Create a workbook table of contents](table-of-contents.md) | This sample creates a table of contents with links to each worksheet. |
| [Count blank rows in a specific sheet or in all sheets](count-blank-rows.md) | This sample detects if there are any blank rows in sheets where you anticipate data to be present and then report the blank row count for usage in a Power Automate flow. |
| [Manage calculation mode in Excel](excel-calculation.md) | This sample shows how to use the calculation mode and calculate methods in Excel using Office Scripts. |
| [Move rows across tables](move-rows-across-tables.md) | This sample shows how to move rows across tables by saving filters, then processing and reapplying the filters. |
| [Notify people with comments](add-excel-comments.md) | This sample adds comments to a cell including @mentioning a colleague. |
| [Output Excel data as JSON](get-table-data.md) | This solution shows how to output Excel table data as JSON to use in Power Automate. |
| [Remove hyperlinks from each cell in an Excel worksheet](remove-hyperlinks-from-cells.md) | This sample clears all of the hyperlinks from the current worksheet. |
| [Set conditional formatting for cross-column comparisons](conditional-formatting-parameters.md) | This sample applies formatting based on values in adjacent columns. It also gets user input through script parameters. |
| [Use external fetch calls](external-fetch-calls.md) | This sample uses `fetch` to get information from GitHub for the script. |

## Cross-application scenarios

Use [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/) to connect other applications to Excel. Have your scripts power emails, forms, Teams messages, and more. These samples include step-by-step instructions to create each Power Automate flow.

| Project | Details |
|---------|---------|
| [Combine worksheets into a single workbook](combine-worksheets-into-single-workbook.md) | This sample uses Office Scripts and Power Automate to pull data from other workbooks into a single workbook. |
| [Convert CSV files to Excel workbooks](convert-csv.md) | This sample uses Office Scripts and Power Automate to create .xlsx files from .csv files. |
| [Cross-reference workbooks](excel-cross-reference.md) | This sample uses Office Scripts and Power Automate to cross-reference and validate information in different workbooks. |
| [Email chart and table images](email-images-chart-table.md) | This sample uses Office Scripts and Power Automate actions to create a chart and send that chart as an image by email. |
| [Record day-to-day changes in Excel and report them with a flow](report-day-to-day-changes.md) | This sample uses a scheduled Power Automate flow to record daily readings and report the changes. |
| [Run a script on all Excel files in a folder](automate-tasks-on-all-excel-files-in-folder.md) | This sample performs a set of automation tasks on all files situated in a folder on OneDrive for Business (can also be used for a SharePoint folder). It performs calculations on the Excel files, adds formatting, and inserts a comment that @mentions a colleague. |
| [Write a large dataset](write-large-dataset.md) | This sample shows how to work with a large range as smaller subranges. This helps flows handle data transfer limits and operation timeouts. |

## Real-world scenarios

Office Scripts can automate parts of your daily routine. These day-to-day tasks often exist in unique ecosystems, with Excel workbooks that are set up in particular ways. These larger scenario samples demonstrate such real-world use-cases. They include both the Office Scripts and the workbooks, so you can see the scenario from end to end.

| Scenario | Details |
|---------|---------|
| [Analyze web downloads](../scenarios/analyze-web-downloads.md) | This scenario features a script that parses web traffic records to determine a user's country of origin. It showcases the skills of text parsing, using subfunctions in scripts, applying conditional formatting, and working with tables. |
| [Fetch and graph water-level data from NOAA](../scenarios/noaa-data-fetch.md) | This scenario uses an Office Script to pull data from an external source (the [NOAA Tides and Currents database](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/)) and graph the resulting information. It highlights the skills of using `fetch` to get data and using charts. |
| [Grade calculator](../scenarios/grade-calculator.md) | This scenario features a script that validates an instructor's record for their class's grades. It showcases the skills of error checking, cell formatting, and regular expressions. |
| [Schedule interviews in Teams](../scenarios/schedule-interviews-in-teams.md) | This scenario shows how to use an Excel spreadsheet to manage interview meeting times and make a flow to schedules meetings in Teams. |
| [Task reminders as Teams cards](../scenarios/task-reminders.md) | This scenario uses an Office Script in a Power Automate flow to send reminders to coworkers to update a project's status. It highlights the skills of Power Automate integration and data transfer to and from scripts. |
