# Run a script on all Excel files in a folder

This project performs a set of automation tasks on all files situated in a folder on OneDrive for Business. It could also be used on a SharePoint folder.
It performs calculations on the Excel files, adds formatting, and inserts a comment that [@mentions](https://support.microsoft.com/office/90701709-5dc1-41c7-aa48-b01d4a46e8c7) a colleague.

## Sample Excel files

Download <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-scripts-docs/blob/master/docs/resources/samples/highlight-alert-excel-files.zip?raw=true">highlight-alert-excel-files.zip</a> for all the workbooks you'll need for this sample. Extract those files to a folder titled **Sales**. Add the following script to your script collection to try the sample yourself!

## Sample code: Add formatting and insert comment

This is the script that runs on each individual workbook. Add it to the sample workbook. Save it as **Review script** and try the sample yourself!

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  // Get the table named "Table1" in the workbook.
  const table1 = workbook.getTable("Table1");

  // If the table is empty, end the script.
  const rowCount = table1.getRowCount();
  if (rowCount === 0) {
    return;
  }

  // Force the workbook to be completely recalculated.
  workbook.getApplication().calculate(ExcelScript.CalculationType.full);

  // Get the "Amount Due" column from the table.
  const amountDueColumn = table1.getColumnByName('Amount Due');
  const amountDueValues = amountDueColumn.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal().getValues();

  // Find the highest amount that's due.
  let highestValue = amountDueValues[0][0];
  let row = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < amountDueValues.length; i++) {
    if (amountDueValues[i][0] > highestValue) {
      highestValue = amountDueValues[i][0];
      row = i;
    }
  }

  let highestAmountDue = table1.getColumn("Amount due").getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal().getRow(row);

  // Set the fill color to yellow for the cell with the highest value in the "Amount Due" column.
  highestAmountDue.getFormat().getFill().setColor("FFFF00");

  // Insert an @mention comment in the cell.
  workbook.addComment(highestAmountDue, {
    mentions: [{
      email: "AdeleV@M365x904181.OnMicrosoft.com",
      id: 0,
      name: "Adele Vance"
    }],
    richContent: "<at id=\"0\">Adele Vance</at> Please review this amount"
  }, ExcelScript.ContentType.mention);
}
```

## Power Automate flow: Run the script on every workbook in the folder
