# Record day-to-day changes in Excel and report them with a Power Automate flow

Power Automate and Office Scripts combine to handle repetitive tasks for you. In this sample, you're tasked with recording a single numerical reading in a workbook every day and reporting the change since yesterday. You'll build a flow to get that reading, log it in the workbook, and report the change through an email.

## Setup: Sample Excel file

This workbook contains the data, objects, and formatting expected by the script.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Download the sample workbook](daily-readings.xlsx)

## Sample code: Record and report daily readings

Add the following script to the sample workbook. Save it as **Record daily value** and try the sample yourself!

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook, newData: string): string {
  // Get the table by its name.
  const table = workbook.getTable("ReadingTable");

  // Read the current last entry in the Reading column.
  const readingColumn = table.getColumnByName("Reading");
  const readingColumnValues = readingColumn.getRange().getValues();
  const previousValue = readingColumnValues[readingColumnValues.length - 1][0] as number;

  // Add a row with the date, new value, and a formula calculating the difference.
  const currentDate = new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleDateString();
  const newRow = [currentDate, newData, "=[@Reading]-OFFSET([@Reading],-1,0)"];
  table.addRow(-1, newRow,);

  // Return the difference between the newData and the previous entry.
  const difference = Number.parseFloat(newData) - previousValue;
  console.log(difference);
  return difference;
}
```

## Sample flow: Report day-to-day changes

Follow these steps to build a [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/) flow for the sample.

1. Create a new **Scheduled cloud flow**.
1. Schedule the flow to repeat every **1 Day**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/day-to-day-changes-flow-1.png" alt-text="The flow creation step showing it will repeat every day.":::

1. Select **Create**.
1. In a real flow, you'll add a step that gets your data. The data can come from another workbook, a Teams adaptive card, or any other source. To test the sample, make a test number. Add an action and choose the **Initialize variable** action. Give it the following values.
    1. **Name**: Input
    1. **Type**: Integer
    1. **Value**: 190000

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/day-to-day-changes-flow-2.png" alt-text="The Initialize variable action with the given values.":::

1. Add an action and choose the **Excel Online (Business)** connector's **Run script** action. Use the following values for the action.
    1. **Location**: OneDrive for Business
    1. **Document Library**: OneDrive
    1. **File**: daily-readings.xlsx *(Chosen through the file browser)*
    1. **Script**: Record daily value
    1. **newData**: Input *(dynamic content)*

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/day-to-day-changes-flow-3.png" alt-text="The Run script action with the given values.":::

1. The script returns the daily reading difference as dynamic content named "result". For the sample, you can email the information to yourself. Add an action and choose the **Outlook** connector's **Send an email (V2)** action (or whatever email client you prefer). Use the following values to complete the action.
    1. **To**: Your email address
    1. **Subject**: Daily reading change
    1. **Body**: "Difference from yesterday:" result *(dynamic content from Excel)*

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/day-to-day-changes-flow-4.png" alt-text="The completed Outlook connector in Power Automate.":::

1. Save the flow and try it out. Use the **Test** button on the flow editor page. Be sure to allow access when prompted.
