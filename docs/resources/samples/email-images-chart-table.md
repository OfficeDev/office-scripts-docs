# Use Office Scripts and Power Automate to email images of a chart and table

This sample uses Office Scripts and Power Automate to create a chart. It then emails images of the chart and its base table.

## Example scenario

* Calculate to get latest results.
* Create chart.
* Get chart and table images.
* Email the images with Power Automate.

_Input data_

:::image type="content" source="../../images/input-data.png" alt-text="A worksheet showing a table of input data.":::

_Output chart_

:::image type="content" source="../../images/chart-created.png" alt-text="The column chart created showing amount due by customer.":::

_Email that was received through Power Automate flow_

:::image type="content" source="../../images/email-received.png" alt-text="The email sent by the flow showing the Excel chart embedded in the body.":::

## Solution

This solution has two parts:

1. [An Office Script to calculate and extract Excel chart and table](#sample-code-calculate-and-extract-excel-chart-and-table)
1. A Power Automate flow to invoke the script and email the results. For an example on how to do this, see [Create an automated workflow with Power Automate](../../tutorials/excel-power-automate-returns.md#create-an-automated-workflow-with-power-automate).

## Setup: Sample Excel file

This workbook contains the data, objects, and formatting expected by the script.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Download the sample workbook](email-chart-table.xlsx)

## Sample code: Calculate and extract Excel chart and table

Add the following script to the sample workbook and try the sample yourself!

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook): ReportImages {
  // Recalculate the workbook to ensure all tables and charts are updated.
  workbook.getApplication().calculate(ExcelScript.CalculationType.full);
  
  // Get the data from the "InvoiceAmounts" table.
  let sheet1 = workbook.getWorksheet("Sheet1");
  const table = workbook.getWorksheet('InvoiceAmounts').getTables()[0];
  const rows = table.getRange().getTexts();

  // Get only the "Customer Name" and "Amount due" columns, then remove the "Total" row.
  const selectColumns = rows.map((row) => {
    return [row[2], row[5]];
  });
  table.setShowTotals(true);
  selectColumns.splice(selectColumns.length-1, 1);
  console.log(selectColumns);

  // Delete the "ChartSheet" worksheet if it's present, then recreate it.
  workbook.getWorksheet('ChartSheet')?.delete();
  const chartSheet = workbook.addWorksheet('ChartSheet');

  // Add the selected data to the new worksheet.
  const targetRange = chartSheet.getRange('A1').getResizedRange(selectColumns.length-1, selectColumns[0].length-1);
  targetRange.setValues(selectColumns);

  // Insert the chart on sheet 'ChartSheet' at cell "D1".
  let chart_2 = chartSheet.addChart(ExcelScript.ChartType.columnClustered, targetRange);
  chart_2.setPosition('D1');

  // Get images of the chart and table, then return them for a Power Automate flow.
  const chartImage = chart_2.getImage();
  const tableImage = table.getRange().getImage();
  return {chartImage, tableImage};
}

// The interface for table and chart images.
interface ReportImages {
  chartImage: string
  tableImage: string
}
```

## Power Automate flow: Email the chart and table images

This flow runs the script and emails the returned images.

1. Create a new **Instant cloud flow**.
1. Choose **Manually trigger a flow** and select **Create**.
1. Add a **New step** that uses the **Excel Online (Business)** connector with the **Run script** action. Use the following values for the action.
    * **Location**: OneDrive for Business
    * **Document Library**: OneDrive
    * **File**: Your workbook ([selected with the file chooser](../../testing/power-automate-troubleshooting.md#select-workbooks-with-the-file-browser-control))
    * **Script**: Your script name

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/email-chart-sample-flow-1.png" alt-text="The completed Excel Online (Business) connector in Power Automate.":::
1. This sample uses Outlook as the email client. You could use any email connector Power Automate supports, but the rest of the steps assume that you chose Outlook. Add a **New step** that uses the **Office 365 Outlook** connector and the **Send and email (V2)** action. Use the following values for the action.
    * **To**: Your test email account (or personal email)
    * **Subject**: Please Review Report Data
    * For the **Body** field, select "Code View" (`</>`) and enter the following:

    ```HTML
    <p>Please review the following report data:<br>
    <br>
    Chart:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="data:image/png;base64,@{outputs('Run_script')?['body/result/chartImage']}"/>
    <br>
    Data:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="data:image/png;base64,@{outputs('Run_script')?['body/result/tableImage']}"/>
    <br>
    </p>
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/email-chart-sample-flow-2.png" alt-text="The completed Office 365 Outlook connector in Power Automate.":::
1. Save the flow and try it out. Use the **Test** button on the flow editor page or run the flow through your **My flows** tab. Be sure to allow access when prompted.
