# Cross-reference Excel files with Power Automate

This solution shows how to compare data across two Excel files to find discrepancies. It uses Office Scripts to analyze data and Power Automate to communicate between the workbooks.

This sample passes data between workbooks using [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) objects. For more information about working with JSON, read [Use JSON to pass data to and from Office Scripts](../../develop/use-json.md).

## Example scenario

You're an event coordinator who is scheduling speakers for upcoming conferences. You keep the event data in one spreadsheet and the speaker registrations in another. To ensure the two workbooks are kept in sync, you use a flow with Office Scripts to highlight any potential problems.

## Sample Excel files

Download the following files to get ready-to-use workbooks for the sample.

1. [event-data.xlsx](event-data.xlsx)
1. [speaker-registrations.xlsx](speaker-registrations.xlsx)

Add the following scripts to try the sample yourself!

## Sample code: Get event data

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook): string {
  // Get the first table in the "Keys" worksheet.
  let table = workbook.getWorksheet('Keys').getTables()[0];

  // Get the rows in the event table.
  let range = table.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal();
  let rows = range.getValues();

  // Save each row as an EventData object. This lets them be passed through Power Automate.
  let records: EventData[] = [];
  for (let row of rows) {
    let [eventId, date, location, capacity] = row;
    records.push({
      eventId: eventId as string,
      date: date as number,
      location: location as string,
      capacity: capacity as number
    })
  }

  // Log the event data to the console and return it for a flow.
  let stringResult = JSON.stringify(records);
  console.log(stringResult);
  return stringResult;
}

// An interface representing a row of event data.
interface EventData {
  eventId: string
  date: number
  location: string
  capacity: number
}
```

## Sample code: Validate speaker registrations

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook, keys: string): string {
  // Get the first table in the "Transactions" worksheet.
  let table = workbook.getWorksheet('Transactions').getTables()[0];

  // Clear the existing formatting in the table.
  let range = table.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal();
  range.clear(ExcelScript.ClearApplyTo.formats);

  // Compare the data in the table to the keys passed into the script.
  let keysObject = JSON.parse(keys) as EventData[];
  let speakerSlotsRemaining = keysObject.map(value => value.capacity);
  let overallMatch = true;

  // Iterate over every row looking for differences from the other worksheet.
  let rows = range.getValues();
  for (let i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {
    let row = rows[i];
    let [eventId, date, location, capacity] = row;
    let match = false;

    // Look at each key provided for a matching Event ID.
    for (let keyIndex = 0; keyIndex < keysObject.length; keyIndex++) {
      let event = keysObject[keyIndex];
      if (event.eventId === eventId) {
        match = true;
        speakerSlotsRemaining[keyIndex]--;
        // If there's a match on the event ID, look for things that don't match and highlight them.
        if (event.date !== date) {
          overallMatch = false;
          range.getCell(i, 1).getFormat()
            .getFill()
            .setColor("FFFF00");
        }
        if (event.location !== location) {
          overallMatch = false;
          range.getCell(i, 2).getFormat()
            .getFill()
            .setColor("FFFF00");
        }

        break;
      }
    }

    // If no matching Event ID is found, highlight the Event ID's cell.
    if (!match) {
      overallMatch = false;
      range.getCell(i, 0).getFormat()
        .getFill()
        .setColor("FFFF00");
    }
  }

  

  // Choose a message to send to the user.
  let returnString = "All the data is in the right order.";
  if (overallMatch === false) {
    returnString = "Mismatch found. Data requires your review.";
  } else if (speakerSlotsRemaining.find(remaining => remaining < 0)){
    returnString = "Event potentially overbooked. Please review."
  }

  console.log("Returning: " + returnString);
  return returnString;
}

// An interface representing a row of event data.
interface EventData {
  eventId: string
  date: number
  location: string
  capacity: number
}
```

## Power Automate flow: Check for inconsistencies across the workbooks

This flow extracts the event information from the first workbook and uses that data to validate the second workbook.

1. Sign into [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) and create a new **Instant cloud flow**.
1. Choose **Manually trigger a flow** and select **Create**.
1. Add a **New step** that uses the **Excel Online (Business)** connector with the **Run script** action. Use the following values for the action.
    * **Location**: OneDrive for Business
    * **Document Library**: OneDrive
    * **File**: event-data.xlsx ([selected with the file chooser](../../testing/power-automate-troubleshooting.md#select-workbooks-with-the-file-browser-control))
    * **Script**: Get event data

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/cross-reference-flow-1.png" alt-text="The completed Excel Online (Business) connector for the first script in Power Automate.":::

1. Add a second **New step** that uses the **Excel Online (Business)** connector with the **Run script** action. This uses the returned values from the **Get event data** script as input for the **Validate event data** script. Use the following values for the action.
    * **Location**: OneDrive for Business
    * **Document Library**: OneDrive
    * **File**: speaker-registration.xlsx ([selected with the file chooser](../../testing/power-automate-troubleshooting.md#select-workbooks-with-the-file-browser-control))
    * **Script**: Validate speaker registration
    * **keys**: result (_dynamic content from **Run script**_)

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/cross-reference-flow-2.png" alt-text="The completed Excel Online (Business) connector for the second script in Power Automate.":::
1. This sample uses Outlook as the email client. You could use any email connector Power Automate supports. Add a **New step** that uses the **Office 365 Outlook** connector and the **Send and email (V2)** action. This uses the returned values from the **Validate speaker registration** script as the email body content. Use the following values for the action.
    * **To**: Your test email account (or personal email)
    * **Subject**: Event validation results
    * **Body**: result (_dynamic content from **Run script 2**_)

    :::image type="content" source="../../images/cross-reference-flow-3.png" alt-text="The completed Office 365 Outlook connector in Power Automate.":::
1. Save the flow. Use the **Test** button on the flow editor page or run the flow through your **My flows** tab. Be sure to allow access when prompted.
1. You should receive an email saying "Mismatch found. Data requires your review." This indicates there are differences between rows in **speaker-registrations.xlsx** and rows in **event-data.xlsx**. Open **speaker-registrations.xlsx** to see several highlighted cells where there are potential problems with the speaker registration listings.
