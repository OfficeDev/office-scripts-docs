## Create a sorted table

This sample creates a table from the current worksheet's used range, then sorts it based on the first column.

```TypeScript
async function main(context: Excel.RequestContext) {
    // Get the current worksheet.
    let workbook = context.workbook;
    let worksheets = workbook.worksheets;
    let selectedSheet = worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Create a table with the used cells.
    let usedRange = selectedSheet.getUsedRange();
    let newTable = selectedSheet.tables.add(usedRange, true);

    // Sort the table using the first column.
    newTable.sort.apply([{ key: 0, ascending: true }]);
}
```

## Delete resolved comments

This sample deletes all resolved comments from the current worksheet.

```TypeScript
async function main(context: Excel.RequestContext) {
    // Get the current worksheet.
    let workbook = context.workbook;
    let worksheets = workbook.worksheets;
    let selectedSheet = worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Get the comments on this worksheet.
    let comments = selectedSheet.comments;
    comments.load("items/resolved");
    await context.sync();

    // Delete the resolved comments.
    comments.items.forEach((comment) => {
        if (comment.resolved) {
            comment.delete();
        }
    });
}
```
