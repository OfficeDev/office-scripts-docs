# Office Scripts sample scenario: Punch clock button

The scenario idea and script used in this sample was contributed by Office Scripts community member [Brian Gonzalez](https://github.com/b-gonzalez).

In this scenario, you'll create a time sheet for an employee that allows them to record their start and end times with a [button](../../develop/script-buttons.md). Based on what's previously been recorded, selecting the button will either start their day (clock in) or end their day (clock out).

## Setup instructions

1. Download the sample workbook to your OneDrive.

    > [Download the sample workbook](punch-clock-sample.xlsx)

1. Open the workbook in Excel.

1. Under the **Automate** tab, select **New Script** and paste the following script into the editor.

    ```typescript
    /**
     * This script records either the start or end time of a shift, 
     * depending on what is filled out in the table. 
     * It is intended to be used with a Script Button.
     */
    function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
      // Get the first table in the timesheet.
      const timeSheet = workbook.getWorksheet("MyTimeSheet");
      const timeTable = timeSheet.getTables()[0];
    
      // Get the appropriate table columns.
      const clockInColumn = timeTable.getColumnByName("Clock In");
      const clockOutColumn = timeTable.getColumnByName("Clock Out");
      const durationColumn = timeTable.getColumnByName("Duration");
    
      // Get the last rows for the Clock In and Clock Out columns.
      let clockInLastRow = clockInColumn.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal().getLastRow();
      let clockOutLastRow = clockOutColumn.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal().getLastRow();
    
      // Get the current date to use as the start or end time.
      let date: Date = new Date();
    
      // Add the current time to a column based on the state of the table.
      if (clockInLastRow.getValue() as string === "") {
        // If the Clock In column has an empty value in the table, add a start time.
        clockInLastRow.setValue(date.toLocaleString());
      } else if (clockOutLastRow.getValue() as string === "") {
        // If the Clock Out column has an empty value in the table, 
        // add an end time and calculate the shift duration.
        clockOutLastRow.setValue(date.toLocaleString());
        const clockInTime = new Date(clockInLastRow.getValue() as string);
        const clockOutTime  = new Date(clockOutLastRow.getValue() as string);
        const clockDuration = Math.abs((clockOutTime.getTime() - clockInTime.getTime()));
    
        let durationString = getDurationMessage(clockDuration);
        durationColumn.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal().getLastRow().setValue(durationString);
      } else {
        // If both columns are full, add a new row, then add a start time.
        timeTable.addRow()
        clockInLastRow.getOffsetRange(1, 0).setValue(date.toLocaleString());
      }
    }
    
    /**
     * A function to write a time duration as a string.
     */
    function getDurationMessage(delta: number) {
      // Adapted from here:
      // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13903897/javascript-return-number-of-days-hours-minutes-seconds-between-two-dates
    
      delta = delta / 1000;
      let durationString = "";
    
      let days = Math.floor(delta / 86400);
      delta -= days * 86400;
    
      let hours = Math.floor(delta / 3600) % 24;
      delta -= hours * 3600;
    
      let minutes = Math.floor(delta / 60) % 60;
    
      if (days >= 1) {
        durationString += days;
        durationString += (days > 1 ? " days" : " day");
    
        if (hours >= 1 && minutes >= 1) {
          durationString += ", ";
        }
        else if (hours >= 1 || minutes > 1) {
          durationString += " and ";
        }
      }
    
      if (hours >= 1) {
        durationString += hours;
        durationString += (hours > 1 ? " hours" : " hour");
        if (minutes >= 1) {
          durationString += " and ";
        }
      }
    
      if (minutes >= 1) {
        durationString += minutes;
        durationString += (minutes > 1 ? " minutes" : " minute");
      }
    
      return durationString;
    }
    ```

1. Rename the script to "Punch clock".

1. Save the script.

1. In the workbook, select cell **E2**.

1. Add a script button. Go to the **More options (â€¦)** menu in the **Script details** page and select **Add in workbook**.

1. Save the workbook.

## Run the script

Select the **Punch clock** button to run the script. It either logs the current time under "Clock In" or "Clock Out", depending on what was previously entered.

> [!NOTE]
> The duration is only recorded if it's longer than a minute. Manually edit the "Clock In" time to test larger durations.
