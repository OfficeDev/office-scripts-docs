# Office Scripts sample scenario: Grade calculator

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a legacy sample that uses the Office Scripts Async APIs. These APIs are only recommended when script performance is critical. This sample is in the process of being converted to the new Office Scripts APIs.

In this scenario, you're an instructor tallying every student's end-of-term grades. You've been entering the scores for their assignments and tests as you go. Now, it is time to determine the students' fates.

You'll develop a script that totals the grades for each point category. It will then assign a letter grade to each student based on the total. To help ensure accuracy, you'll add a couple checks to see if any individual scores are too low or high. If a student's score is less than zero or more than the possible point value, the script will flag the cell with a red fill and not total that student's points. This will be a clear indication of which records you need to double-check. You'll also add some basic formatting to the grades so you can quickly view the top and bottom of the class.

## Scripting skills covered

- Cell formatting
- Error checking
- Regular expressions

## Setup instructions

1. Download <a href="grade-calculator.xlsx">grade-calculator.xlsx</a> to your OneDrive.

2. Open the workbook with Excel for the web.

3. Under the **Automate** tab, open the **Code Editor**.

4. In the **Code Editor** task pane, press **New Script** and paste the following script into the editor.

    ```TypeScript
    async function main(context: Excel.RequestContext) {
      // Get the number of student record rows.
      let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
      let studentsRange = sheet.getUsedRange().load("values, rowCount");
      await context.sync();
      console.log("Total students: " + (studentsRange.rowCount - 1));

      // Clean up any formatting from previous runs of the script.
      studentsRange.clear(Excel.ClearApplyTo.formats);
      studentsRange.getColumn(4).getCell(0, 0).getRowsBelow(studentsRange.rowCount - 1).clear(Excel.ClearApplyTo.all);
      studentsRange.getColumn(5).getCell(0, 0).getRowsBelow(studentsRange.rowCount - 1).clear(Excel.ClearApplyTo.all);
      await context.sync();

      // Parse the headers for the maximum possible scores for each category.
      // The format is `category (score)`.
      let assignmentsMax = studentsRange.values[0][1].match(/\d+/)[0];
      let midTermMax = studentsRange.values[0][2].match(/\d+/)[0];
      let finalsMax = studentsRange.values[0][3].match(/\d+/)[0];
      console.log("Assignments max score:" + assignmentsMax);
      console.log("Mid-term max score: " + midTermMax);
      console.log("Final max score: " + finalsMax);

      // Look at every student row.
      for (let i = 1; i < studentsRange.values.length; i++) {
        let row = studentsRange.values[i];
        let total = row[1] + row[2] + row[3];
        let valid = true;

        // Look for any records that are too low or too high.
        if (row[1] < 0 || row[1] > assignmentsMax) {
          studentsRange.getCell(i, 1).format.fill.color = "Red";
          valid = false;
        }
        if (row[2] < 0 || row[2] > midTermMax) {
          studentsRange.getCell(i, 2).format.fill.color = "Red";
          valid = false;
        }
        if (row[3] < 0 || row[3] > finalsMax) {
          studentsRange.getCell(i, 3).format.fill.color = "Red";
          valid = false;
        }

        // If the scores are valid, total that student's points and assign them a letter grade.
        if (valid) {
          let grade: string;
          switch (true) {
            case total < 60:
              grade = "E";
              break;
            case total < 70:
              grade = "D";
              break;
            case total < 80:
              grade = "C";
              break;
            case total < 90:
              grade = "B";
              break;
            default:
              grade = "A";
              break;
          }

          studentsRange.getCell(i, 4).values = [[total]];
          studentsRange.getCell(i, 5).values = [[grade]];

          // Highlight excellent students and those in need of attention.
          if (grade === "A") {
            studentsRange.getCell(i, 5).format.fill.color = "Green";
          } else if (grade === "E" || grade === "D") {
            studentsRange.getCell(i, 5).format.fill.color = "Orange";
          }
        }
      }

      studentsRange.getColumn(5).format.horizontalAlignment = "Center";
    }
    ```

5. Rename the script to **Grade Calculator** and save it.

## Running the script

Run the **Grade Calculator** script on the only worksheet. The script will total the grades and assign each student a letter grade. If any individual grades have more points than the assignment or test is worth, then the offending grade is marked red and the total is not calculated.
