# Differences between Office Scripts and Office Add-ins

Office Add-ins and Office Scripts have a lot in common. They both offer automated control of an Excel workbook a JavaScript API. However, the Office Scripts APIs are a specialized, synchronous version of the Office JavaScript API.

Office Scripts run to completion with a manual button press or as a step in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/), whereas Office Add-ins persist while their task panes are open. This means the add-ins can maintain state during a session, whereas Office Scripts do not maintain an internal state between runs. If you find that your Excel extension needs to exceed the scripting platform's capabilities, visit the [Office Add-ins documentation](/office/dev/add-ins) to learn more about Office Add-ins.

The rest of this article describes on the main differences between Office Add-ins and Office Scripts.

## Platform Support

Office Add-ins are cross-platform. They work across Windows desktop, Mac, iOS, and web platforms and provide the same experience on each. Any exception to this is noted in the documentation of the individual API.

Office Scripts are currently only supported by for Excel on the web. All recording, editing, and running is done on the web platform.

## APIs

There is no synchronous version of the Office JavaScript APIs for Office Add-ins. The standard Office Scripts APIs are unique to the platform and have numerous optimizations and alterations to avoid the usage of the `load`/`sync` paradigm.

Some of the [Excel JavaScript APIs](/javascript/api/excel?view=excel-js-preview) are compatible with the [Office Scripts Async APIs](../develop/excel-async-model.md). Some samples and add-in code blocks could be ported to `Excel.run` blocks with minimal translation. While the two platforms share functionality, there are gaps. The two major API sets that Office Add-ins have but Office Scripts do not are events and the Common APIs.

### Events

Office Scripts do not support [events](/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-events). Every script runs the code in a single `main` method, then ends. It does not reactivate when events are triggered, and thus, cannot register events.

### Common APIs

Office Scripts cannot use [Common APIs](/javascript/api/office). If you need authentication, dialog windows, or other features that are only supported by Common APIs, you'll likely need to create an Office Add-in instead of an Office Script.
