[!INCLUDE [Public preview](../includes/preview-note.md)]

A [script button](../overview/excel.md#create-script-buttons-preview) created in Excel on the web runs scripts when pressed in Excel on Windows. This allows Windows client users to use scripts. To create or edit a button or script, you still need to use the web client.
