Before starting this tutorial, you'll need access to Office Scripts, which requires the following:

- [Excel on the web](https://www.office.com/launch/excel).

- Ask your administrator to [enable Office Scripts for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/office-scripts-settings-in-m365-19d3c51a-6ca2-40ab-978d-60fa49554dcf), which adds the **Automate** tab to the ribbon in Excel on the web.
