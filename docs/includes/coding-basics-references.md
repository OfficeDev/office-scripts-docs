- Learn the basics of JavaScript. You should feel comfortable with concepts like variables, control flow, functions, and data types. [Mozilla offers a good, comprehensive tutorial on JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction).
- Learn about types in TypeScript. TypeScript builds on JavaScript by ensuring at compile-time the right types are used for method calls and assignments. The TypeScript documentation on [interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html), [classes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html), [type inference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html), and [type compatibility](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html) will be the most useful.
