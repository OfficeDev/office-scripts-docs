Before starting this tutorial, you'll need access to the following applications:

- [Power Automate](/power-automate/organization-q-and-a).
- [Excel on the web](https://www.office.com/launch/excel).
- Ask your administrator to [enable Office Scripts for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-office-scripts-settings), which adds the **Automate** tab to the ribbon in Excel on the web.
