> To use Office Scripts in [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), you must have a [business license of Microsoft 365](../testing/platform-limits.md?tabs=business). The Office 365 Enterprise E1 and Office 365 F3 licenses can use Scripts with Power Automate, but don't have Power Automate integrations directly in Excel.
