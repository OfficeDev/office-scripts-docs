# Use JSON to pass data to and from Office Scripts

[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) is a format for storing and transferring data. Each JSON object is a collection of name/value pairs that can be defined when created. JSON is useful with Office Scripts because it can handle the arbitrary complexity of ranges, tables, and other data patterns in Excel. JSON lets you parse incoming data from [web services](external-calls.md) and pass complex objects through a [Power Automate flow](power-automate-integration.md).

This article focuses on using JSON with Office Scripts. We recommend learning more about the format first, from articles such as this [JSON Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) from W3 Schools.
