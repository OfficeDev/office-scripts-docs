# How to use macro files in Power Automate flows

The [Excel Online (Business) connector](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_excelonlinebusiness/excel-online-business/) in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/) typically only works with files in the Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx) format. The file browser limits your selection to .xlsx files inside the connector. However, macro files are compatible with the connector's **Run script** action if the file metadata is used.

In your flow, use the **Get File Metadata** action from either the [OneDrive for Business](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_onedriveforbusiness/onedrive-for-business/) or [SharePoint](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_sharepointonline/sharepoint/) connectors. The **Run script** action accepts this metadata as a valid file. Use the *ID* dynamic content returned from the **Get file metadata** action as the "File" argument when running the script. The following screenshot shows a flow providing the metadata for a file called "Test Macro File.xlsm" to a **Run script** action.

> Some .xlsm files, especially those with ActiveX or Form controls, may not work in the Excel online connector. Be sure to test before deploying your solution.
