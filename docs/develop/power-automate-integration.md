# Run Office Scripts with Power Automate

[Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com) lets you add Office Scripts to a larger, automated workflow. You can use Power Automate do things like add the contents of an email to a worksheet's table or create actions in your project management tools based on workbook comments.

## Get started

If you are new to Power Automate, we recommend visiting [Get started with Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started). There, you can learn more about all the automation possibilities available to you. The documents here focus on how Office Scripts work with Power Automate and how that can help improve your Excel experience.

### Step-by-step tutorials

There are three step-by-step tutorials for Power Automate and Office Scripts. These show how to combine the automate services and pass data between a workbook and a flow.

- [Tutorial: Update a spreadsheet from a Power Automate flow](../tutorials/excel-power-automate-manual.md)
- [Tutorial: Automatically save content from emails in a workbook](../tutorials/excel-power-automate-trigger.md)
- [Tutorial: Send weekly email reminders based on spreadsheet data](../tutorials//excel-power-automate-returns.md)

### Create a flow from Excel

You can get started with Power Automate in Excel with a variety of flow templates. Under the **Automate** tab, select **Automate a Task**.

:::image type="content" source="../images/automate-a-task-button.png" alt-text="The 'Automate a Task' button in the ribbon.":::

This opens a task pane with several options to begin connecting your Office Scripts to larger automated solutions. Select any option to begin. Your flow is supplied with the current workbook.

> [!TIP]
> You can also start making a flow from the **More options (â€¦)** menu on an individual script.

## Excel connector

The [Excel Online (Business) connector](/connectors/excelonlinebusiness) gives your flows access to Excel workbooks. There are two actions that call Office Scripts.

- **Run script**. This is the action to use with scripts stored in the [default location of your OneDrive](../overview/script-storage.md#onedrive).
- **Run script from SharePoint library**. This is the action to use when scripts are stored in your team's SharePoint site.

# [Run script](#tab/run-script)

For the **Run script** action, the script location is always in your OneDrive.

:::image type="content" source="../images/run-script.png" alt-text="The Run script action with completed fields that show the location is 'OneDrive for Business', the document library is 'OneDrive', the file is 'daily-readings.xlsx', and the script is named 'Format Table'.":::

# [Run script from SharePoint library](#tab/run-script-sp)

For the **Run script from SharePoint library** action, you specify the location of the workbook and script separately.

:::image type="content" source="../images/run-script-from-sp-library.png" alt-text="The Run script from SharePoint library action with completed fields that show the workbook location is 'OneDrive for Business', the workbook library is 'OneDrive', the workbook is 'daily-readings.xlsx', the script location is 'Group - Office Platform', the script library is 'Documents', and the script is named 'Format Table'.":::

### Data security in Office Scripts with Power Automate

The "Run script" action gives people who use the Excel connector significant access to your workbook and its data. Additionally, there are security risks with scripts that make external API calls, as explained in [External calls from Power Automate](external-calls.md). If your admin is concerned with the exposure of highly sensitive data, they can either turn off the Excel Online connector or restrict access to Office Scripts through the [Office Scripts administrator controls](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-office-scripts-settings).

For admins who have enabled Conditional Access policies for unmanaged devices in their tenant, it's a best practice to disable Power Automate on unmanaged devices. This process is detailed in the blog post [Control Access to Power Apps and Power Automate with Azure AD Conditional Access Policies](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/control-access-to-power-apps-and-power-automate-with-azure-ad-conditional-access-policies/).

## Data transfer in flows for scripts

Power Automate lets you pass pieces of data between flow actions. Scripts can be configured to accept the information you need and return what you want from your workbook to your flow. Data is passed to scripts as static values, [expressions](/power-automate/use-expressions-in-conditions), or dynamic content. Details on an individual service's connector can be found in the [Power Automate Connector documentation](/connectors/).

Learn the details of how to pass data to and from your scripts with the following documentation.

- Learn by doing with [Tutorial: Automatically save content from emails in a workbook](../tutorials/excel-power-automate-trigger.md) and [Tutorial: Send weekly email reminders based on spreadsheet data](../tutorials/excel-power-automate-returns.md).
- Try the [Automated task reminders](../resources/scenarios/task-reminders.md) sample scenario to see everything in action.
- Read [Pass data to and from scripts in Power Automate](power-automate-parameters-returns.md) for more usage scenarios and the technical TypeScript details.

## Example

The following screenshot shows a Power Automate flow that's triggered whenever a [GitHub](https://github.com/) issue is assigned to you. The flow runs a script that adds the issue to a table in an Excel workbook. If there are five or more issues in that table, the flow sends an email reminder.

:::image type="content" source="../images/power-automate-parameter-return-sample.png" alt-text="The Power Automate flow editor showing the example flow.":::

The `main` function of the script specifies the issue ID and issue title as input parameters, and the script returns the number of rows in the issue table.

```TypeScript
function main(
  workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook,
  issueId: string,
  issueTitle: string): number {
  // Get the "GitHub" worksheet.
  let worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet("GitHub");

  // Get the first table in this worksheet, which contains the table of GitHub issues.
  let issueTable = worksheet.getTables()[0];

  // Add the issue ID and issue title as a row.
  issueTable.addRow(-1, [issueId, issueTitle]);

  // Return the number of rows in the table, which represents how many issues are assigned to this user.
  return issueTable.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal().getRowCount();
}
```
