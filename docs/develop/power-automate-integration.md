# Run Office Scripts with Power Automate

[Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) lets you add Office Scripts to a larger, automated workflow. You can use Power Automate do things like add the contents of an email to a worksheet's table or create actions in your project management tools based on workbook comments.

## Get started

If you are new to Power Automate, we recommend visiting [Get started with Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started). There, you can learn more about all the automation possibilities available to you. The documents here focus on how Office Scripts work with Power Automate and how that can help improve your Excel experience.

### Step-by-step tutorials

There are three step-by-step tutorials for Power Automate and Office Scripts. These show how to combine the automate services and pass data between a workbook and a flow.

- [Call scripts from a manual Power Automate flow](../tutorials/excel-power-automate-manual.md)
- [Pass data to scripts in an automatically-run Power Automate flow](../tutorials/excel-power-automate-trigger.md)
- [Return data from a script to an automatically-run Power Automate flow](../tutorials//excel-power-automate-returns.md)

### Create a flow from Excel

You can get started with Power Automate in Excel with a variety of flow templates. Under the **Automate** tab, select **Automate a Task**.

:::image type="content" source="../images/automate-a-task-button.png" alt-text="The 'Automate a Task' button in the ribbon.":::

This opens a task pane with several options to begin connecting your Office Scripts to larger automated solutions. Select any option to begin. Your flow is supplied with the current workbook.

> [!TIP]
> You can also start making a flow from the **More options (â€¦)** menu on an individual script.

## Excel Online (Business) connector

[Connectors](/connectors/connectors) are the bridges between Power Automate and applications. The [Excel Online (Business) connector](/connectors/excelonlinebusiness) gives your flows access to Excel workbooks. The "Run script" action lets you call any Office Script accessible through the selected workbook. You can also give your scripts input parameters so data can be provided by the flow, or have your script return information for later steps in the flow.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The "Run script" action gives people who use the Excel connector significant access to your workbook and its data. Additionally, there are security risks with scripts that make external API calls, as explained in [External calls from Power Automate](external-calls.md). If your admin is concerned with the exposure of highly sensitive data, they can either turn off the Excel Online connector or restrict access to Office Scripts through the [Office Scripts administrator controls](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-office-scripts-settings).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power Automate does **not** support scripts stored on SharePoint at this time.

## Data transfer in flows for scripts

Power Automate lets you pass pieces of data between steps of your flow. Scripts can be configured to accept whatever types of information you need and return anything from your workbook that you want in your flow. Input for your script is specified by adding parameters to the `main` function (in addition to `workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook`). Output from the script is declared by adding a return type to `main`.

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a "Run Script" block in your flow, the accepted parameters and returned types are populated. If you change the parameters or return types of your script, you'll need to redo the "Run script" block of your flow. This ensures the data is being parsed correctly.

The following sections cover the details of input and output for scripts used in Power Automate. If you'd like a hands-on approach to learning this topic, try out the [Pass data to scripts in an automatically-run Power Automate flow](../tutorials/excel-power-automate-trigger.md) tutorial or explore the [Automated task reminders](../resources/scenarios/task-reminders.md) sample scenario.

### `main` Parameters: Pass data to a script

All script input is specified as additional parameters for the `main` function. For example, if you wanted a script to accept a `string` that represents a name as input, you would change the `main` signature to `function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook, name: string)`.

When you're configuring a flow in Power Automate, you can specify script input as static values, [expressions](/power-automate/use-expressions-in-conditions), or dynamic content. Details on an individual service's connector can be found in the [Power Automate Connector documentation](/connectors/).

#### Type restrictions

When adding input parameters to a script's `main` function, consider the following allowances and restrictions. These also apply to the return type of the script.

1. The first parameter must be of type `ExcelScript.Workbook`. Its parameter name doesn't matter.

1. The types `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `unknown`, `object`, and `undefined` are supported.

1. Arrays (both `[]` and `Array<T>` styles) of the previously listed types are supported. Nested arrays are also supported.

1. Union types are allowed if they are a union of literals belonging to a single type (such as `"Left" | "Right"`, not `"Left", 5`). Unions of a supported type with undefined are also supported (such as `string | undefined`).

1. Object types are allowed if they contain properties of type `string`, `number`, `boolean`, supported arrays, or other supported objects. The following example shows nested objects that are supported as parameter types.

    ```TypeScript
    // The Employee object is supported because Position is also composed of supported types.
    interface Employee {
        name: string;
        job: Position;
    }

    interface Position {
        id: number;
        title: string;
    }
    ```

1. Objects must have their interface or class definition defined in the script. An object can also be defined anonymously inline, as in the following example.

    ```TypeScript
    function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook): {name: string, email: string}
    ```

#### Optional and default parameters

1. Optional parameters are allowed and are denoted with the optional modifier `?` (for example, `function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook, Name?: string)`).

1. Default parameter values are allowed (for example `function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook, Name: string = 'Jane Doe')`.

### Return data from a script

Scripts can return data from the workbook to be used as dynamic content in a Power Automate flow. The [same type restrictions listed previously](#type-restrictions) apply to the return type. To return an object, add the return type syntax to the `main` function. For example, if you wanted to return a `string` value from the script, your `main` signature would be `function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook): string`.

## Example

The following screenshot shows a Power Automate flow that's triggered whenever a [GitHub](https://github.com/) issue is assigned to you. The flow runs a script that adds the issue to a table in an Excel workbook. If there are five or more issues in that table, the flow sends an email reminder.

:::image type="content" source="../images/power-automate-parameter-return-sample.png" alt-text="The Power Automate flow editor showing the example flow.":::

The `main` function of the script specifies the issue ID and issue title as input parameters, and the script returns the number of rows in the issue table.

```TypeScript
function main(
  workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook,
  issueId: string,
  issueTitle: string): number {
  // Get the "GitHub" worksheet.
  let worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet("GitHub");

  // Get the first table in this worksheet, which contains the table of GitHub issues.
  let issueTable = worksheet.getTables()[0];

  // Add the issue ID and issue title as a row.
  issueTable.addRow(-1, [issueId, issueTitle]);

  // Return the number of rows in the table, which represents how many issues are assigned to this user.
  return issueTable.getRangeBetweenHeaderAndTotal().getRowCount();
}
```
