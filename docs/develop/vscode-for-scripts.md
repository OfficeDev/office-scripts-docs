# Visual Studio Code for Office Scripts (preview)

[Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev/) lets users edit anything from anywhere. Connect your Office Scripts experience to this popular code editor to start scripting outside of the workbook.

Visual Studio Code has a few advantages over the built-in Code Editor.

- Full-screen editing! Your script doesn’t have to share screen space with the workbook any more.
- Edit multiple scripts at once! Quickly switch between scripts to share code from your other automations.
- Extensions! Use your favorite VS Code extensions for spell checking, formatting, and whatever else helps you get the job done.
