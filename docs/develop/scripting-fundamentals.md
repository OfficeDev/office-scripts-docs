# Scripting fundamentals for Office Scripts in Excel on the web (preview)

This article will introduce you to the technical aspects of Office Scripts. You'll learn how the Excel objects work together and how the Code Editor synchronizes with a workbook.

[!INCLUDE [Preview note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

## `main` function

Each Office Script must contain the `main` function with the `ExcelScript.Workbook` type as its first parameter. When the function is executed, Excel application invokes this `main` function by providing the workbook as its first parameter. Hence, it is important to not modify the basic signature of the `main` function once you have either recorded the script or created a new script from the code editor.

```typescript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
// Your code goes here
}
```

The code inside the `main` function runs when the script is run. `main` can call other functions in your script, but code that's not contained in a function will not run.

> [!CAUTION]
> If your `main` function looks like `async function main(context: Excel.RequestContext)`, then your script is using the legacy, async API model. Please refer to [Using the Office Scripts Async APIs to support legacy scripts](excel-async-model.md) for more information, including how to convert your older script to the current API model.

## Object model

To write a script, you need to understand how the Office Script APIs fit together. The components of a workbook have specific relations to one another. In many ways, these relations match those of the Excel UI.

- A **Workbook** contains one or more **Worksheets**.
- A **Worksheet** gives access to cells through **Range** objects.
- A **Range** represents a group of contiguous cells.
- **Ranges** are used to create and place **Tables**, **Charts**, **Shapes**, and other data visualization or organization objects.
- A **Worksheet** contains collections of those data objects that are present in the individual sheet.
- **Workbooks** contain collections of some of those data objects (such as **Tables**) for the entire **Workbook**.

### Workbook

Every script is provided a `workbook` object of type `Workbook` by the `main` function. This represents the top level object through which your script interacts with the Excel workbook.

The following script gets the active worksheet from the workbook and logs its name.

```typescript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the active worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Display the current worksheet's name.
    console.log(sheet.getName());
}
```

### Ranges

A range is a group of contiguous cells in the workbook. Scripts typically use A1-style notation (e.g. **B3** for the single cell in column **B** and row **3** or **C2:F4** for the cells from columns **C** through **F** and rows **2** through **4**) to define ranges.

Ranges have three core properties: values, formulas, and format. These properties get or set the cell values, formulas to be evaluated, and the visual formatting of the cells. They are accessed through `getValues`, `getFormulas`, and `getFormat`. Values and formulas can be changed with `setValues` and `setFormulas`, while the format is a `RangeFormat` object that's comprised of several smaller objects that are individually set.

Ranges use two-dimensional arrays to manage information. Read the [Working with ranges section of Using built-in JavaScript objects in Office Scripts](javascript-objects.md#working-with-ranges) for more information on handling those arrays in the Office Scripts framework.

#### Range sample

The following sample shows how to create sales records. This script uses `Range` objects to set the values, formulas, and parts of the format.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the active worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Create the headers and format them to stand out.
    let headers = [["Product", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Totals"]];
    let headerRange = sheet.getRange("B2:E2");
    headerRange.setValues(headers);
    headerRange.getFormat().getFill().setColor("#4472C4");
    headerRange.getFormat().getFont().setColor("white");

    // Create the product data rows.
    let productData = [
        ["Almonds", 6, 7.5],
        ["Coffee", 20, 34.5],
        ["Chocolate", 10, 9.56],
    ];
    let dataRange = sheet.getRange("B3:D5");
    dataRange.setValues(productData);

    // Create the formulas to total the amounts sold.
    let totalFormulas = [
        ["=C3 * D3"],
        ["=C4 * D4"],
        ["=C5 * D5"],
        ["=SUM(E3:E5)"],
    ];
    let totalRange = sheet.getRange("E3:E6");
    totalRange.setFormulas(totalFormulas);
    totalRange.getFormat().getFont().setBold(true);

    // Display the totals as US dollar amounts.
    totalRange.setNumberFormat("$0.00");
}
```

Running this script creates the following data in the current worksheet:

### Charts, tables, and other data objects

Scripts can create and manipulate the data structures and visualizations within Excel. Tables and charts are two of the more commonly used objects, but the APIs support PivotTables, shapes, images, and more. These are stored in collections, which will be discussed later in this article.

#### Creating a table

Create tables by using data-filled ranges. Formatting and table controls (such as filters) are automatically applied to the range.

The following script creates a table using the ranges from the previous sample.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the active worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Add a table that has headers using the data from B2:E5.
    sheet.addTable("B2:E5", true);
}
```

Running this script on the worksheet with the previous data creates the following table:

![A table made from the previous sales record.](../images/table-sample.png)

#### Creating a chart

Create charts to visualize the data in a range. Scripts allow for dozens of chart varieties, each of which can be customized to suit your needs.

The following script creates a simple column chart for three items and places it 100 pixels below the top of the worksheet.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the active worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Create a column chart using the data from B3:C5.
    let chart = sheet.addChart(
        ExcelScript.ChartType.columnStacked,
        sheet.getRange("B3:C5")
    );

    // Set the margin of the chart to be 100 pixels from the top of the screen.
    chart.setTop(100);
}
```

Running this script on the worksheet with the previous table creates the following chart:

![A column chart showing quantities of three items from the previous sales record.](../images/chart-sample.png)

### Collections and other object relations

Any child object can be accessed through its parent object. For example, you can read `Worksheets` from the `Workbook` object. There will be a related `get` method on the parent class that (e.g. `Workbook.getWorksheets()` or `Workbook.getWorksheet(name)`). `get` methods that are singular return a single object and require an ID or name for the specific object (such as the name of a worksheet). `get` methods that are plural return the entire object collection as an array. If the collection is empty, you'll get an empty array (`[]`).

Once the collection is retrieved, you can use regular array operations such as getting its `length` or use `for`, `for..of`, `while` loops for iteration or use TypeScript array methods such as `map`, `forEach` on them. You can also access individual objects within the collection using the array index value. For example, `workbook.getTables()[0]` returns the first table in the collection. Read the [Working with collections section of Using built-in JavaScript objects in Office Scripts](javascript-objects.md#working-with-collections) to learn more about using built-in array functionality with the Office Scripts framework.

The following script gets all tables in the workbook. It then ensures the headers are displays, the filter buttons are visible, and the table style is set to "TableStyleLight1".

```typescript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  /* Get table collection */
  const tables = workbook.getTables();
  /* Set table formatting properties */
  tables.forEach(table => {
    table.setShowHeaders(true);
    table.setShowFilterButton(true);
    table.setPredefinedTableStyle("TableStyleLight1");
  })
}
```

#### Adding Excel objects with a script

You can programmatically add document objects, such as tables or charts, by calling the corresponding `add` method available on the parent object.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not manually add objects to collection arrays. Use the `add` methods on the parent objects For example, add a `Table` to a `Worksheet` with the `Worksheet.addTable` method.

The following script creates a table in Excel on the first worksheet in the workbook. Note that the created table is returned by the `addTable` method.

```typescript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the first worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getWorksheets()[0];

    // Add a table that uses the data in C3:G10.
    let table = sheet.addTable(
      "C3:G10",
       true /* True because the table has headers. */
    );
}
```

## Removing Excel objects with a script

To delete an object, call the object's `delete` method.

> [!NOTE]
> As with adding objects, do not manually remove objects from collection arrays. Use the `delete` methods on the collection-type objects. For example, remove a `Table` from a `Worksheet` using `Table.delete`.

The following script removes the first worksheet in the workbook.

```typescript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get first worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getWorksheets()[0];

    // Remove that worksheet from the workbook.
    sheet.delete();
}
```
