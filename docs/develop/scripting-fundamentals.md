# Scripting fundamentals for Office Scripts in Excel on the web

This article will introduce you to the technical aspects of Office Scripts. You'll learn how the Excel objects work together and how the Code Editor synchronizes with a workbook.

## TypeScript: The language of Office Scripts

Office Scripts are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html), which is a superset of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript). If you're familiar with JavaScript, your knowledge will carry over because much of the code is the same in both languages. We recommend you have some beginner-level programming knowledge before starting your Office Scripts coding journey. The following resources can help you understand the coding side of Office Scripts.

[!INCLUDE [Recommended coding resources](../includes/coding-basics-references.md)]

## `main` function: The script's starting point

Each script must contain a `main` function with the `ExcelScript.Workbook` type as its first parameter. When the function runs, the Excel application invokes the `main` function by providing the workbook as its first parameter. An `ExcelScript.Workbook` should always be the first parameter.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  // Your code goes here
}
```

The code inside the `main` function runs when the script is run. `main` can call other functions in your script, but code that's not contained in a function will not run. Scripts cannot invoke or call other Office Scripts.

[Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) allows you to connect scripts in flows. Data is passed between the scripts and the flow through the parameters and returns of the`main` method. How to integrate Office Scripts with Power Automate is covered in detail in [Run Office Scripts with Power Automate](power-automate-integration.md).

## Object model overview

To write a script, you need to understand how the Office Scripts APIs fit together. The components of a workbook have specific relations to one another. In many ways, these relations match those of the Excel UI.

- A **Workbook** contains one or more **Worksheets**.
- A **Worksheet** gives access to cells through **Range** objects.
- A **Range** represents a group of contiguous cells.
- **Ranges** are used to create and place **Tables**, **Charts**, **Shapes**, and other data visualization or organization objects.
- A **Worksheet** contains collections of those data objects that are present in the individual sheet.
- **Workbooks** contain collections of some of those data objects (such as **Tables**) for the entire **Workbook**.

## Workbook

Every script is provided a `workbook` object of type `Workbook` by the `main` function. This represents the top level object through which your script interacts with the Excel workbook.

The following script gets the active worksheet from the workbook and logs its name.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the active worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Display the current worksheet's name.
    console.log(sheet.getName());
}
```

## Ranges

A range is a group of contiguous cells in the workbook. Scripts typically use A1-style notation (e.g., **B3** for the single cell in column **B** and row **3** or **C2:F4** for the cells from columns **C** through **F** and rows **2** through **4**) to define ranges.

Ranges have three core properties: values, formulas, and format. These properties get or set the cell values, formulas to be evaluated, and the visual formatting of the cells. They are accessed through `getValues`, `getFormulas`, and `getFormat`. Values and formulas can be changed with `setValues` and `setFormulas`, while the format is a `RangeFormat` object comprised of several smaller objects that are individually set.

Ranges use two-dimensional arrays to manage information. For more information on handling arrays in the Office Scripts framework, see [Work with ranges](javascript-objects.md#work-with-ranges).

### Range sample

The following sample shows how to create sales records. This script uses `Range` objects to set the values, formulas, and parts of the format.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the active worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Create the headers and format them to stand out.
    let headers = [["Product", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Totals"]];
    let headerRange = sheet.getRange("B2:E2");
    headerRange.setValues(headers);
    headerRange.getFormat().getFill().setColor("#4472C4");
    headerRange.getFormat().getFont().setColor("white");

    // Create the product data rows.
    let productData = [
        ["Almonds", 6, 7.5],
        ["Coffee", 20, 34.5],
        ["Chocolate", 10, 9.54],
    ];
    let dataRange = sheet.getRange("B3:D5");
    dataRange.setValues(productData);

    // Create the formulas to total the amounts sold.
    let totalFormulas = [
        ["=C3 * D3"],
        ["=C4 * D4"],
        ["=C5 * D5"],
        ["=SUM(E3:E5)"],
    ];
    let totalRange = sheet.getRange("E3:E6");
    totalRange.setFormulas(totalFormulas);
    totalRange.getFormat().getFont().setBold(true);

    // Display the totals as US dollar amounts.
    totalRange.setNumberFormat("$0.00");
}
```

Running this script creates the following data in the current worksheet:

:::image type="content" source="../images/range-sample.png" alt-text="A worksheet containing a sales record consisting of value rows, a formula column, and formatted headers.":::

### The types of Range values

Each cell has value. This value is the underlying value entered into the cell, which may be different from the text displayed in Excel. For example, you might see "5/2/2021" displayed in the cell as a date, but the actual value is 44318. This display can be changed with the number format, but the actual value and type in the cell only changes when a new value is set.

When you are using the cell value, it's important to tell TypeScript what value you are expecting to get from a cell or range. A cell contains one of the following types: `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. In order for your script to treat the returned values as one of those types, you must declare the type.

The following script gets the average price from the table in the previous sample. Note the code `priceRange.getValues() as number[][]`. This [asserts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions) the type of the range values to be a `number[][]`. All the values in that array can then be treated as numbers in the script.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  // Get the active worksheet.
  let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

  // Get the "Unit Price" column. 
  // The result of calling getValues is declared to be a number[][] so that we can perform arithmetic operations.
  let priceRange = sheet.getRange("D3:D5");
  let prices = priceRange.getValues() as number[][];

  // Get the average price.
  let totalPrices = 0;
  prices.forEach((price) => totalPrices += price[0]);
  let averagePrice = totalPrices / prices.length;
  console.log(averagePrice);
}
```

## Charts, tables, and other data objects

Scripts can create and manipulate the data structures and visualizations within Excel. Tables and charts are two of the more commonly used objects, but the APIs support PivotTables, shapes, images, and more. These are stored in collections, which will be discussed later in this article.

### Create a table

Create tables by using data-filled ranges. Formatting and table controls (such as filters) are automatically applied to the range.

The following script creates a table using the ranges from the previous sample.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the active worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Add a table that has headers using the data from B2:E5.
    sheet.addTable("B2:E5", true);
}
```

Running this script on the worksheet with the previous data creates the following table:

:::image type="content" source="../images/table-sample.png" alt-text="A worksheet containing a table made from the previous sales record.":::

### Create a chart

Create charts to visualize the data in a range. Scripts allow for dozens of chart varieties, each of which can be customized to suit your needs.

The following script creates a simple column chart for three items and places it 100 pixels below the top of the worksheet.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the active worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Create a column chart using the data from B3:C5.
    let chart = sheet.addChart(
        ExcelScript.ChartType.columnStacked,
        sheet.getRange("B3:C5")
    );

    // Set the margin of the chart to be 100 pixels from the top of the screen.
    chart.setTop(100);
}
```

Running this script on the worksheet with the previous table creates the following chart:

:::image type="content" source="../images/chart-sample.png" alt-text="A column chart showing quantities of three items from the previous sales record.":::

## Collections

When an Excel object has a collection of one or more objects of the same type, it stores them in an array. For example, a `Workbook` object contains a `Worksheet[]`. This array is accessed by the `Workbook.getWorksheets()` method. `get` methods that are plural, such as `Worksheet.getCharts()`, return the entire object collection as an array. You'll see this pattern throughout the Office Scripts APIs: the `Worksheet` object has a `getTables()` method that returns a `Table[]`, the `Table` object has a `getColumns()` method that returns a `TableColumn[]`, as so on.

The returned array is a normal array, so all the regular array operations are available for your script. You can also access individual objects within the collection using the array index value. For example, `workbook.getTables()[0]` returns the first table in the collection. For more information on using the built-in array functionality with the Office Scripts framework, see [Work with collections](javascript-objects.md#work-with-collections). 

Individual objects are also accessed from the collection through a `get` method. `get` methods that are singular, such as `Worksheet.getTable(name)`, return a single object and require an ID or name for the specific object. This ID or name is usually set by the script or through the Excel UI.

The following script gets all tables in the workbook. It then ensures the headers are displays, the filter buttons are visible, and the table style is set to "TableStyleLight1".

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  // Get the table collection.
  let tables = workbook.getTables();

  // Set the table formatting properties for every table.
  tables.forEach(table => {
    table.setShowHeaders(true);
    table.setShowFilterButton(true);
    table.setPredefinedTableStyle("TableStyleLight1");
  })
}
```

## Add Excel objects with a script

You can programmatically add document objects, such as tables or charts, by calling the corresponding `add` method available on the parent object.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not manually add objects to collection arrays. Use the `add` methods on the parent objects For example, add a `Table` to a `Worksheet` with the `Worksheet.addTable` method.

The following script creates a table in Excel on the first worksheet in the workbook. Note that the created table is returned by the `addTable` method.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the first worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getWorksheets()[0];

    // Add a table that uses the data in A1:G10.
    let table = sheet.addTable(
      "A1:G10",
       true /* True because the table has headers. */
    );
    
    // Give the table a name for easy reference in other scripts.
    table.setName("MyTable");
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Most Excel objects have a `setName` method. This gives you an easy way to access Excel objects later in the script or in other scripts for the same workbook.

### Verify an object exists in the collection

Scripts often need to check if a table or similar object exists before continuing. Use the names given by scripts or through the Excel UI to identify necessary objects and act accordingly. `get` methods return `undefined` when the requested object is not in the collection.

The following script requests a table named "MyTable" and uses an `if...else` statement to check if the table was found.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  // Get the table named "MyTable".
  let myTable = workbook.getTable("MyTable");

  // If the table is in the workbook, myTable will have a value.
  // Otherwise, the variable will be undefined and go to the else clause.
  if (myTable) {
    let worksheetName = myTable.getWorksheet().getName();
    console.log(`MyTable is on the ${worksheetName} worksheet`);
  } else {
    console.log(`MyTable is not in the workbook.`);
  }
}
```

A common pattern in Office Scripts is to recreate a table, chart, or other object every time the script is run. If you don't need the old data, it's best to delete the old object before creating the new one. This avoids name conflicts or other differences that may have been introduced by other users.

The following script removes the table named "MyTable", if it is present, then adds a new table with the same name.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  // Get the table named "MyTable" from the first worksheet.
  let sheet = workbook.getWorksheets()[0];
  let tableName = "MyTable";
  let oldTable = sheet.getTable(tableName);

  // If the table exists, remove it.
  if (oldTable) {
    oldTable.delete();
  }

  // Add a new table with the same name.
  let newTable = sheet.addTable("A1:G10", true);
  newTable.setName(tableName);
}
```

## Remove Excel objects with a script

To delete an object, call the object's `delete` method.

> [!NOTE]
> As with adding objects, do not manually remove objects from collection arrays. Use the `delete` methods on the collection-type objects. For example, remove a `Table` from a `Worksheet` using `Table.delete`.

The following script removes the first worksheet in the workbook.

```TypeScript
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get first worksheet.
    let sheet = workbook.getWorksheets()[0];

    // Remove that worksheet from the workbook.
    sheet.delete();
}
```
