# Run Office Scripts in Excel from buttons

Help your colleagues find and run your scripts by adding script buttons to a workbook.

## Create script buttons

When viewing a script, select **Add in workbook**. This creates a button in the workbook that runs the associated script. It also shares the script with the workbook, so everyone with write permissions to the workbook can use your helpful automation.

## Remove script buttons

To stop sharing a script through a button, select the arrow next to **Add in workbook** and choose the option **Remove from workbook**. This removes all the buttons that run the script. Deleting a single button removes the script from that one button, even if the operation is undone or the button is cut and pasted.

## Older versions of Excel

Script buttons won't work when opened in [versions of Excel that don't support Office Scripts](../testing/platform-limits.md#platform-support). In that case, the button still appears, but selecting it has no effect.
