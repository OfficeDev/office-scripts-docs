# Office Scripts in Excel on the web (preview)

Office Scripts in Excel on the web let you automate tasks. You can record your Excel actions with the Action Recorder, which creates a script. You can also create and edit scripts with the Code Editor. This series of documents teaches you how to use these tools. You'll be introduced to the Action Recorder and see how to record your frequent Excel actions. You'll also learn how to make or update your own scripts with the Code Editor.

## Action Recorder

The Action Recorder records actions you take in Excel and translates them into a script. With the Action recorder running, you can capture the Excel actions as you edit cells, change formatting, and create tables. The resulting script can be run on other worksheets and workbooks to recreate your original actions with a single button press.

## Code Editor

All scripts recorded with the Action Recorder can be edited through the Code Editor. This lets you tweak and customize the script to better suit your exact needs. You can also add logic and functionality that is not directly accessible through the Excel UI, such as conditional statements (if/else) and loops.

One easy way to start learning the capabilities of Office Scripts is to record scripts in Excel on the web and view the resulting code. Another option is to follow our [tutorial](../tutorials/excel-tutorial.md) to learn in a more guided and structured way.
