## When to use Office Scripts

Scripts allow you to record and replay your Excel actions on different workbooks and worksheets. If you find yourself doing the same things over and over again, an Office Script can help you by reducing your whole workflow to a single button press.

As an example, say you start your work day by opening a .csv file from an accounting site in Excel. You then spend several minutes deleting unnecessary columns, formatting a table, adding formulas, and creating a PivotTable in a new worksheet. Those actions you repeat daily can be recorded once with the Action Recorder. For then on, running the script will take care of your entire .csv conversion. You'll not only remove the risk of forgetting steps, but be able to share your process with others without having to teach them anything. Office Scripts automate your common tasks so you and your workplace can be more efficient and productive.

## Action Recorder

The Action Recorder records actions you take in Excel and translates them into a script. With the Action recorder running, you can capture the Excel actions as you edit cells, change formatting, and create tables. The resulting script can be run on other worksheets and workbooks to recreate your original actions.

## Code Editor

All scripts recorded with the Action Recorder can be edited through the Code Editor. This lets you tweak and customize the script to better suit your exact needs. You can also add logic and functionality that is not directly accessible through the Excel UI, such as conditional statements (if/else) and loops.

One easy way to start learning the capabilities of Office Scripts is to record scripts in Excel on the web and view the resulting code. Another option is to follow our [tutorials](../tutorials/excel-tutorial.md) to learn in a more guided and structured way.
