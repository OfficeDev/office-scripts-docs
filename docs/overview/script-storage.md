# Office Scripts file storage and ownership

Office Scripts are stored as **.osts** files in your Microsoft OneDrive. They are stored separately from a workbook. To give others access, [share the script with an Excel workbook](excel.md#share-office-scripts). This means you're linking the script with the file, not attaching it. Whoever has access to the Excel file will also be able to view, run, or make a copy of the script.

Unless you share your scripts, no one else can access them. Your OneDrive settings control the shared access and permissions for all script **.osts** files, independent of any Excel settings. Scripts can't be linked from a local disk or custom cloud locations. Office Scripts only recognizes and runs a script if it's in your OneDrive folder or shared with the workbook.

## File storage

You Office Scripts are stored in your OneDrive. The **.osts** files are found in the **/Documents/Office Scripts/** folder. Any edits made to these **.osts** files, such as renaming or deleting files, will be reflected in the Code Editor and Script Gallery.

Scripts that are shared with one of your workbooks remain in the script creator's OneDrive. They are not copied to any of your local or OneDrive folders when you run the shared script in Excel. The **Make a Copy** button of the Code Editor saves a separate copy of the script in your OneDrive. Changes to the copy don't affect the original script.

### Restore deleted scripts

When you delete a script in Excel, it goes to your OneDrive recycle bin. To restore a deleted script, follow the steps listed in [Restore deleted files or folders in OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/office/949ada80-0026-4db3-a953-c99083e6a84f). Restoring an **.osts** file returns it to the **All scripts** list.

A deleted script is unshared with the workbook. When you restore a script, it does **not** retain its script access. You will need to share the script again.

Restored scripts still work as expected with Power Automate flows. You don't need to recreate the flow connector.

## File ownership and retention

Office Scripts are stored in a user's OneDrive. They follow the retention and deletion policies specified by Microsoft OneDrive. To learn how to handle scripts that were created and shared by a user being removed from your organization, see [OneDrive retention and deletion](/onedrive/retention-and-deletion).

During editing, files are temporarily stored in the browser. You must save the script before closing the Excel window to save it to the OneDrive location. Don't forget to save the file after edits, or else those edits will only be in the browser's version of the file.

## Audit Office Scripts usage at the admin level

Discover which tenants are using Office Scripts with the audit log in the compliance center. To learn how to use this tool, visit [Search the audit log in the Security & Compliance Center](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true#search-the-audit-log).

To find who is using Office Scripts with the search tool, add `.osts` in the **File, folder, or site** field. This searches for all files with the Office Scripts file extension. If anyone in your organization has used the Office Scripts feature, the user activity shows up in the audit log search results.

> [!NOTE]
> Running a script is currently not logged. Only the create, view, and modify actions are logged.
