# Office Scripts Code Editor environment

Office Scripts are written in either [TypeScript or JavaScript](#scripting-language-typescript-or-javascript) and use the [Office Scripts JavaScript APIs](#office-scripts-javascript-api) to interact with an Excel workbook.

## Scripting language: TypeScript or JavaScript

Office Scripts are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) or [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript). The Action Recorder generates code in TypeScript (which is a superset of JavaScript). Office Scripts documentation uses TypeScript, but if you're more comfortable with JavaScript, you can use that instead.

Office Scripts are largely self-contained pieces of code. Only a small part of TypeScript's functionality is used. Therefore, you can edit scripts without having to learn the intricacies of TypeScript. The Code Editor also handles the installation, compilation, and execution of code, so you don't need to worry about anything but the script itself. It's possible to learn the language and create scripts without previous programming knowledge. However, if you're new to programming, we recommend learning some fundamentals before proceeding with Office Scripts:

- Learn the basics of JavaScript. You should feel comfortable with concepts like variables, control flow, functions, and data types. [Mozilla offers a good, comprehensive tutorial on JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction).
- Learn about types in TypeScript. TypeScript builds on JavaScript by ensuring at compile-time the right types are used for method calls and assignments. The TypeScript documentation on [interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html), [classes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html), [type inference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html), and [type compatibility](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html) will be the most useful.

## Office Scripts JavaScript API

Office Scripts use a specialized version the Office JavaScript APIs for [Office Add-ins](/office/dev/add-ins/overview/index). While there are similarities in the two APIs, you should not assume code can be ported between the two platforms. The differences between the two platforms are described in the [Differences between Office Scripts and Office Add-ins](../resources/add-ins-differences.md#apis) article. You can view all the APIs available to your script in the [Office Scripts API reference documentation](/javascript/api/office-scripts/overview).

## IntelliSense

IntelliSense is a Code Editor feature that helps prevent typos and syntax errors as you edit your script. It displays possible object and field names as you type, as well as inline documentation for every API.

The Excel Code Editor uses the same IntelliSense engine as Visual Studio Code. To learn more about the feature, visit [Visual Studio Code's IntelliSense Features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense#_intellisense-features).

## External library support

Office Scripts do not support the usage of external, third-party JavaScript libraries. You are currently unable to call any library other than the Office Scripts APIs from a script. You do still have access to any [built-in JavaScript object](../develop/javascript-objects.md), such as [Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math).

## Browser support

Office Scripts work in any browser that [supports Office for the web](https://support.microsoft.com/office/ad1303e0-a318-47aa-b409-d3a5eb44e452). However, some JavaScript features aren't supported in Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11). Any features introduced in [ES6 or later](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp) won't work with IE 11. If people in your organization still use that browser, be sure to test your scripts in that environment when sharing them.
